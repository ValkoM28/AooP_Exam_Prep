This is to practice basics like creating classes, constructors and so on

✨Objective:✨
Create a small console application that tracks books in a library using classes, constructors, and object initializers.

Create a class Book with the following properties:
Title (string)
Author (string)
YearPublished (int)
IsCheckedOut (bool)

Create two constructors for the Book class:
A default constructor.
A parameterized constructor that initializes all properties.

Create another class Library that contains:
A list of Book objects (List<Book>).


A method AddBook(Book book) to add a book.

A method DisplayBooks() to list all books with their details.

In the Main method:
Create at least two books using the constructor.
Create at least two books using object initializer syntax.
Add all books to the library.
Call DisplayBooks() to show the added books.
